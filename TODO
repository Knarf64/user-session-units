TODO

1. Obsolete this package entirely
 a) user-session@.service should probably end up back in systemd.
 b) xorg-launch-helper should be obsolete once XOrg becomes properly
    socket-activated. At which point we should ship the service files
    from xorg-launch-helper in xorg-server itself.
 c) Same for wayland.
 d) All the desktop-specific service files should be shipped by
    upstream projects.
